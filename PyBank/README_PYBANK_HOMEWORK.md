### THIS README OUTLINES THE STEPS TAKEN TO COMPLETE PYBANK HOMEWORK.
  * All the extra files are shown in this folder to show the link and the steps I used to complete this homework.
      1. main_going-through-tuples_and_dictionaries.ipynb
        * This file was where I ultimately resolved all code blocks until I was able to get to the solution.
        * I included hyperlinks to websites which helped me derive the solution.
      2. working-with-tuples.ipynb
        * I tried solving using tuples.
        * I converted the csv to a dictionary, and then converted the dictionary to a tuple.
      3. main_working.ipynb
        * This file is where I cleaned up unused code blocks.
        * I had additional hyperlinks in this file to help me with the long f'strings.
      4. main.ipynb
        * This file is the last iteration before I converted it to a Python file.
      5. main.py
        * This is the final Python file for the solution to the homework.
